VIX PREDICTION MODEL COMPARISON - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================

Date: January 19, 2026
Analysis Period: 2005-2019 (3,597 trading days)

MODELS COMPARED:
1. Naive Baseline (yesterday's VIX)
2. AR3 (autoregressive model with 3 lags)
3. SAMoVAR (Structural-Aligned Mixture of VAR)

OVERALL RESULTS:
---------------
Ranking by MAE:
  1. Naive:  1.045 (BEST)
  2. AR3:    1.090
  3. SAMoVAR: 1.309 (WORST)

Ranking by Win Rate (days won):
  1. AR3:    36.1% (1,297 days)
  2. Naive:  33.8% (1,214 days)
  3. SAMoVAR: 30.2% (1,086 days)

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
✓ Naive baseline achieves lowest overall error (MAE: 1.045)
✓ AR3 wins on most individual days (36.1%)
✓ SAMoVAR underperforms both baselines
✓ SAMoVAR struggles most during high volatility periods
✓ Primary issue: Overfitting (test loss 2-3x validation loss)

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS:
--------------------
SAMoVAR vs AR3:      AR3 wins 54.5% of days
SAMoVAR vs Naive:    Naive wins 58.0% of days
AR3 vs Naive:        Naive wins 54.1% of days

PERFORMANCE BY VIX LEVEL:
-------------------------
Low VIX (<15):       SAMoVAR MAE: 0.63, AR3 MAE: 0.60
Medium VIX (15-20):  SAMoVAR MAE: 1.14, AR3 MAE: 0.98
High VIX (20-30):    SAMoVAR MAE: 1.93, AR3 MAE: 1.42
Very High (>30):     SAMoVAR MAE: 3.88, AR3 MAE: 3.22

ROOT CAUSE OF SAMoVAR UNDERPERFORMANCE:
----------------------------------------
1. Overfitting: Model too complex for available data
2. Small training window: 3-year rolling window insufficient
3. Architecture mismatch: Transformer overkill for univariate task
4. Hyperparameters: Dropout too low, learning rate potentially too high
