  Median: 16.20
  Min:    9.14
  Max:    82.69
  Current 75th Percentile Threshold: 24.69

HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION
---------------------
  ✓ Lower returns than stocks:        YES (11.3% vs 15.1%)
  ✓ Significantly lower volatility:   YES (13.2% vs 17.1% = 22% reduction)
  ✗ Better Sharpe ratio:              NO  (0.706 vs 0.767)
  ✓ Lower max drawdown:               YES (-31.5% vs -34.0%)

CONCLUSION
----------
The VIX switching strategy successfully reduces volatility by ~22% and provides 
downside protection with a smaller maximum drawdown. However, in this strong bull 
market period (2011-2025), the return sacrifice was too large to improve the 
risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio). The strategy would likely perform better 
in sideways or bear markets.
